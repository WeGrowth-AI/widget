description: Treat dist/ as read-only build output for Chrome loading
globs: dist/**

## Dist Directory Rules

- Do not edit files under `dist/**`. They are generated/copies for Chrome Dev mode.
- Source of truth is under `extension/**`.
- When testing, copy `extension/` â†’ `dist/` to refresh assets and [manifest.json](mdc:dist/manifest.json).
